# Employee-Code-Quiz

## Description
In this project we created a timed quiz where the timer would start once the "Start Quiz" button is clicked and the first question would pop up. If a question is answered incorrectly, the time limit is reduced by 5 seconds as a penalty. Once all the questions have been answered or the timer reaches zero, the quiz is ended and the user is prompted to ender their initials in order to log their score and there is an option to try again.
